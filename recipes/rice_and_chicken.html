    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish offers a p
        erfect harmony of seasoned chicken breast, 
        seared to a golden yellow, slightly crispy on the outside 
        and tender on the inside, paired with a creamy rice bed 
        (reminiscent of risotto or orzo rice). 
        The chicken was pan-simmered over high heat, 
        seasoned with aromatic spices such as freshly 
        ground black pepper and possibly red chili powder, 
        resulting in a rich aroma and appetizing texture.</p>

    <p>The rice bed, forming the base of the dish, 
        stands out with its creamy sauce and slightly 
        glossy appearance. Likely enriched with garlic,
         Parmesan cheese, and a touch of cream, this 
         rice-based layer has a delicate flavor profile 
         that balances the spicy intensity of the chicken. 
         Sprinkles of fresh parsley add color, while a drizzle 
         of extra virgin olive oil and black 
        pepper completes the gourmet presentation.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts (cut in half lengthwise) </li>
            <li>1 cup rice or barley noodles</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic (crushed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2.5 cups chicken broth (hot)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cream or grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt, freshly ground black pepper, sweet paprika, dried thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>For garnish: Half a bunch of finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preparation and Seasoning: Pat the chicken breasts dry. 
                Generously season both sides with salt, plenty of black pepper, 
                and red paprika powder.
            </li>
            <li>Searing the Chicken: Heat olive oil and a tablespoon of 
                butter in a large pan. Place the chicken in the pan and 
                cook until golden brown on both sides (about 5-6 minutes per side). 
                Remove the cooked chicken to a plate and let it rest.
            </li>
            <li>Aromatic Base: Add the remaining butter to the same pan. 
                Add the crushed garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Cooking the Rice/Vermicelli: Add the rice or vermicelli and sauté for 2
                 minutes until translucent. Then, gradually add the hot chicken broth,
                  simmering over low heat until the rice is tender and has absorbed the 
                  liquid.
                </li>
            <li>Creamy Touch: Once the rice is cooked, add the cream or Parmesan 
                cheese and stir quickly. Turn off the heat when the sauce has 
                slightly thickened and reached a velvety consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Assembling: Spread the prepared creamy base onto a serving plate.
                 Slice the rested chicken breasts and place them on top of the rice.
                </li>
            <li>Serving: Garnish with freshly chopped parsley, extra black pepper,
                 and if desired, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Serve hot.
                </li>
        </ol>
